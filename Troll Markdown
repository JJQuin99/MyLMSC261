# Git Troll Markddown
I went into the explore page in found a repository for a server in Rust. I noticed only one person at a time would update changes in spans of a few days or couple weeks apart. It made me think of the Band site assignment because we were having trouble with overwriting each others work when we would all upload different things. Its always interesting to see the actual work and process behind a project.
