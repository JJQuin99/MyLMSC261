# Lets Begin
⋅⋅- a computer is a clock with benifits⋅⋅
⋅⋅- you can do everything a computer can, the computer can just do it faster and infinitly if u tell it too
### 2.1 How do you type an "A"?
⋅⋅- computers are not simple and they do not "think" simply, everything for them is a lengthy process done faster
⋅⋅- coders are the people who are willing to work backwards through that lengthy process and make sense of it and solve ⋅⋅⋅⋅potential problems that arise
### 2.2 From Hardware to Software
⋅⋅- 1950s is when coders started creating software solutions for everyday quality of life conviences, but it didnt take off ⋅⋅⋅⋅until the 80s⋅⋅
⋅⋅- part of coding is taking what is already there and improving on it
### 2.3 How Does Coding Become Software?
⋅⋅- code: a sequence of symbols (using typical keyboard characters, saved to a file of some kind) that someone typed in, ⋅⋅⋅⋅copied, or pasted from elsewhere⋅⋅
⋅⋅- your goal is to turn your code into a list of instructions that can be carried out by interconnected logic gates, thus ⋅⋅⋅⋅turning your code into something that can be excecuted, Software⋅⋅
⋅⋅- a compiler is software that takes symbols you type and turns them into low level instructions (think bolus)
⋅⋅⋅⋅- every character matters⋅⋅
⋅⋅- The process of examining letter by letter and turning it into instruction is called a function, or mayn other names, and ⋅⋅⋅⋅can be run as often as needed.
### 2.4 What is an Algorithm?
⋅⋅- a programming language is a system for encoding, naming and organizing algorithms for reuse and application.⋅⋅
⋅⋅- an Algorithm can be translated into a function and that function can be called (run) when software is excecuted.⋅⋅
⋅⋅- the hardest work in programming is getting around things that arent possible. finding ways to break up these impossible ⋅⋅⋅⋅tasks in to smallar possible components, creating the impression that the computer is doing something it actually isnt.⋅⋅
⋅⋅- programming languages have at least 2 jobs. it needs too⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅⋅1. wrap up lots of algorithms so they can be reused⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅⋅2. make it easy for programmers to wrap up new algorithms and routines into functions for reuse⋅⋅
⋅⋅- the DRY (dont repeat yourself) principle is important. you should name things once, do things once, create a function once, ⋅⋅⋅⋅and let the computer repeat itself.
### 2.5 The Sprint
⋅⋅- TMitTB represents a program that tests programs.⋅⋅
⋅⋅- TMitTB tests every possible usage of the program and notifies the programmers of errors or unaccsessablilities.⋅⋅
## 2.6 Whats With All these conferences anyway
⋅⋅- Women in tech fields are often harrased at confrences and in general (of course bc its a male dominated field ⋅⋅⋅⋅and men are trash)⋅⋅
⋅⋅- the problem with women in technology isnt the women⋅⋅
